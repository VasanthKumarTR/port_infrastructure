# Quick Start Guide for Updated Setup Scripts

## üöÄ What's New

The setup scripts have been improved to support **selective configuration updates**! No more repeating successful steps.

### New Features

1. **Interactive Menu**: Choose which components to configure
2. **Existing Config Detection**: Shows what's already configured  
3. **Selective Updates**: Update only specific credentials
4. **Smart Defaults**: Keep existing working configurations
5. **Fresh vs Update Mode**: Start fresh or update existing

## üìã How to Use

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Option 1: Bash script (recommended for macOS/Linux)
./setup.sh

# Option 2: Python script (cross-platform)
python3 setup.py
```

### Updating Existing Configuration
When you run the script again, you'll see:

```
Configuration file found. Do you want to update specific components or start fresh? (update/fresh):
```

**Choose "update"** to selectively modify components.

### Interactive Menu Options

```
Configuration Menu
==================

Select what you want to configure/update:

1) Port.io credentials (Required)
2) Environment settings  
3) AWS integration
4) GitHub integration
5) Azure integration
6) Azure DevOps integration
7) Snyk integration
8) Team configuration
9) Configure all missing components

```

## üéØ Example Workflows

### Scenario 1: Add GitHub Integration to Existing Config
1. Run `./setup.sh`
2. Choose "update" mode
3. Select option "4) GitHub integration"
4. Enter your GitHub App details
5. Choose "0) Continue with current configuration"

### Scenario 2: Update Only Port.io Credentials  
1. Run `./setup.sh`
2. Choose "update" mode
3. Select option "1) Port.io credentials"
4. Enter new credentials
5. Choose "0) Continue with current configuration"

### Scenario 3: Configure All Missing Components

4. Script will ask about each missing integration

## üîß Smart Features

### Existing Configuration Detection
The script shows what's already configured:
```
Checking Existing Configuration
===============================

‚úÖ Port.io credentials found
‚úÖ AWS credentials found  
‚úÖ GitHub configuration found
```

### Keep Existing Values
For each component, you can choose to keep existing values:
```
Current Client ID: your-client-id-here
Keep current Port.io credentials? (y/n):
```

### Validation Before Saving
Credentials are still validated before being saved to ensure they work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Your GitHub App

Since you have your GitHub App private key ready, here's how to test:

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Choose update mode** (if config exists)

3. **Select GitHub integration** (option 4)

4. **Enter your details:**
   - App ID: (from your GitHub App settings)
   - Installation ID: (from the installation URL)
   - Private Key: (paste the entire content from your .pem file)
   - Organization: VasanthKumarTR (your GitHub username/org)
   - Repository: port-infrastructure

5. **Continue** and test with validation script:
   ```bash
   ./validate.sh
   ```

## üìÅ File Management

- **Automatic Backups**: Existing config is backed up before changes
- **Incremental Updates**: Only modified sections are updated
- **Preserve Comments**: Configuration file structure is maintained

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Script Asks for Everything Again
- Make sure you're choosing "update" mode, not "fresh"
- Check that terraform.tfvars exists in the current directory

### GitHub App Issues
- Ensure you copied the entire private key including headers
- Verify the App ID and Installation ID are correct
- Check that the app is installed in your organization

### Validation Failures
- Run `./validate.sh` to see specific issues
- Each component can be reconfigured individually

Ready to test the improved setup experience! üéâ
